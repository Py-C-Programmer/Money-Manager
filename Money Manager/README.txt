1. User of the program can create different types of cards (debit and credit), change their parameters (name of the bank, number, expiration date etc) for more
comfortable work with them; you can charge or withdraw money by different categories.

2. This program ('Money Manager') is actually not for real transfer and storage of funds, but for analyzing their traffic. So it can be used, for example, to
analyze the expenses and income (budget) of a family for a day, a week or a month (you create a card and enter the necessary data there).

3. The folder, where the program is, will also store the Statistics.txt file. The entire analysis is stored there.
